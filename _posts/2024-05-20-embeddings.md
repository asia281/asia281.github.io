# Embeddings
An embedding layer is a word embedding that is learned jointly with a neural network model on a specific natural language processing task.

## Bag of words

The CBOW model learns the embedding by predicting the current word based on its context.

## Skip-gram

The continuous skip-gram model learns by predicting the surrounding words given a current word.

## Word2vec
