# Overview

Sample code for different techniques can be found there: https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Decorators

 
## Data structures

### Lists

### Dict

### Set

## Inheritance

## Decorators

A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. 

*args, **kwargs

### Classes as decorators

## Generators
A generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over. 

We can define a generator function using the def keyword, but instead of the return statement we use the yield statement. When the generator function is called, it does not execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to produce the values.

### Generator expression

It is similar to a list comprehension, but instead of creating a list, it creates a generator object that can be iterated over to produce the values in the generator. Syntax:

````markdown
```python
# create the generator object
squares_generator = (i * i for i in range(5))

# iterate over the generator and print the values
for i in squares_generator:
    print(i)

# or
print(next(squares_generator))
```
````



### Advantages
- does not store an entire sequence in the memory
- you can represent an infinite stream
- pipelining generators:

```python
def fibonacci_numbers(nums):
    x, y = 0, 1
    for _ in range(nums):
        x, y = y, x+y
        yield x

def square(nums):
    for num in nums:
        yield num**2

print(sum(square(fibonacci_numbers(10))))

# Output: 4895
```
