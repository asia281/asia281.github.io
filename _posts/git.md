## Why?

Causal structure discovery aims to recover the ground truth graph G. The solution to this problem is not uniquely defined when having access only to observational data from the ground truth distribution $P$. Formally, it can be determined solely up to a Markov Equivalence Class [MEC]({% post_url markov_equivalence_class %}) without additional restrictive assumptions. To achieve identifiability, data from interventions need to be gathered.

## Intervention

$$P() P(Xi|PAi) \Phi P(X_j|PA_j).$$

## Steps

# Method

1. GIT scores each possible intervention target by calculating the expected magnitude of the gradient using imaginary interventional data generated by the causal model. Gradient magnitude serves as a proxy for the size of the update that can be induced on the parameters of the causal model. For a given intervention we define:

$$ s_i = E||\nabla _\rho \mathbb{L}(X)||$$

The expected value is computed with the interventional distribution coming from the model.

The expected value in $s_i$ is approximated using the Monte-Carlo method (line 4).
